# Sea Battle
Sea Battle is a game for two players. The game is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are typically square - usually 10x10 - and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number. On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records their own shots.
